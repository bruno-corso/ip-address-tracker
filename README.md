# IP Address Tracker Solution üåê ü§ñ

As part of a challenge from Frontend Mentor, this project aims to track IP addresses around the world and show them on a map. Take a look and discover your IP address. üöÄ

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size üñ•Ô∏è üì±
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page :electron:
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load üó∫Ô∏è
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location üîé

## My Process

### Built With

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [IPify (API IPs)](https://www.ipify.org/)
- [Leaflet (Map)](https://leafletjs.com/)


### What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to integrate various technologies to build a functional and visually appealing IP address tracker. Some key learnings include:

- Implementing responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Using TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience in a React project
- Fetching and displaying data from an API to show IP address information on a map

Here's an example of some code I'm proud of:

tsx
// Example TypeScript code
const fetchIpDetails = async (ip: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ipgeolocation.io/ipgeo?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&ip=${ip}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
};
